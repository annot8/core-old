/**
 * This package contains the core interface for bounds.
 * 
 * Bounds are the object used to set the extent of an annotation,
 * and will be specific to the content type. For instance, if the
 * content is text then the bounds will likely allow the beginning
 * and end offset to be specified.
 * 
 * There may be more than one type of valid bound for any given content.
