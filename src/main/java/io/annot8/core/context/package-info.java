/**
 * This package contains the core interface for the context object.

 * A context object is passed to each component when it is configured,
 * and contains the relevant settings for that component as well as any
 * resources required by it.
 * 
 * The context is component specific, and a new context should be created
 * for each component whenever it is configured.
