/**
 * This package contains the core interfaces for annotations and groups of annotations.
 * 
 * An Annotation is a marking which indicates that a region of some content
 * has some special properties or meaning. For instance, it might indicate
 * that a span of text is a mention of an Entity (for example a Person).
 * 
 * A Group is a collection of annotations. For example, a group could represent a
 * relationship between annotations, an event containing multiple annotations, or
 * indicate that a collection of annotations refer to the same entity. Within a
 * group, all annotations must have a role assigned (although they could all be
 * assigned the same role).
